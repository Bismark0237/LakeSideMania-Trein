# TODO: Merge Left Turn Elif Statements in Notities main Dimi.py

- [ ] Merge the two consecutive elif blocks for left turns (lines ~128 and ~132) into a single elif block with combined patterns.
- [ ] Inside the merged block, add logic to determine sharpness based on the matched pattern (SMOOTH_TURN for smooth patterns, SHARP_TURN for sharp patterns).
- [ ] Test the line following program to ensure left turns work correctly for both smooth and sharp cases.
